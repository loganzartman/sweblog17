## What did you do this past week?
I took a hiatus from SWE this week and spent a lot of time getting my Operating Systems project out of the way. It was the threads project and was our first venture into the glorious [Pintos](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html). I found that while in OS we spent a lot of time writing a little code, in SWE we spent a lot of time writing a lot of code (excluding the several thousand Node modules we installed to generate our homepage). 

## What's in your way?
There's so little time and so much to do.

## What will you do next week?
1. Get together to start planning out the database and backend for our site
2. Finish out my first set of midterms
3. Write a better blog post

## What's my experience of the class?
Python is a cool language. I'm starting to see why a lot of things were done the way they were. I was looking into other, more poorly-designed languages, like JavaScript, and found that a lot of similar things are just worse. An important construct in Python is the [Iterator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Iterator), and more specifically the [Generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators). A Generator is an Iterator that is specifically designed to be lazy--that is, it only generates or computes its values when asked to. Generator comprehensions: `(f(x) for x in iterable)` are an easy way to build them. One of the things that Python does well is that it implements `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` as functions of a function and an iterable. By combining these with generators, we can transform data without doing any computation until we need to. JavaScript also has [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators), but its `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions are methods of Array instances--it's not trivial to apply them to generators.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I haven't been doing a lot of work for SWE this week so I haven't found anything super relevant. However, I figured I'd share [this website](https://www.redblobgames.com/), which features interactive articles on algorithms for game development. It's written by [a Stanford alum](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/) and has really cool demos alongside the articles. I've found it really helpful several times myself. Here's an article on [the A* algorithm](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html).
