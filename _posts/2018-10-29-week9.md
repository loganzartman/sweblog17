## What did you do this past week?
The team worked on getting our [Flask][1]/[SQLAlchemy][2]/[Flask_SQLAlchemy][3] backend communicating with our GCP Cloud SQL Postgres database. We also worked on getting our React frontend communicating with our API to render our website dynamically instead of using our old test dataset. Getting our backend communicating with the DB proved to be [a little bit frustrating][last week] to me. One crucial misunderstanding that I had was that *the Cloud SQL instance name is not the name of the database*. Though this was certainly an oversight on my part, there was no clear error indicating to me that I was trying to connect to a database that did not exist, so I had no idea. It is entirely possible that [`pg8000`][pg8000] would have worked, but it is probably better to use the more popular [`psycopg2`][psycopg2] instead.

Once we had established that our backend was doing its thing (see tip-of-the-week), [I wrote][commit] the simplest-possible dynamic component in React. It uses the [fetch API][fetch] to simply make `GET` requests to our API endpoints (e.g. [http://poupon.me/api/hello](http://poupon.me/api/hello)) and render the results into our components. I think that our simple method of performing a single fetch when a component is ready to mount, and later displaying the results is all we need to do. We don't expect the data provided by our endpoints to change in real time.

## What's in your way?
I'm still trying to find an internship for this summer. I'm a sophomore and would really like to have some professional experience going into next year. We'll see.

## What will you do next week?
1. Register for classes 
2. Think about how to improve the implementation of our RESTful React components
3. Not fall asleep while writing my blog post

## What's my experience of the class?
Prof. Downing's pragmatic approach to databases has helped me pick up a working knowledge of SQL and relational algebra very quickly. I took Data Management for about as long as we've been learning SQL, and did not pick up nearly as much. Of course, I'm probably missing a lot of the theory behind it.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Deploying to the App Engine Flexible Environment takes us a solid 8 to 12 minutes. No, we are not deploying `.git` or `node_modules`. So, we like to be able to test our API endpoints before we deploy them. This can be accomplished using the [Cloud SQL Proxy][proxy] to provide a local connection to our test database, and [Flask's test_client][test_client], to simulate requests to our API endpoints in Python. There's really not much to it, but if you want to see how we do it, you can look [here][our tests].
