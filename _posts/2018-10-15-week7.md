## What did you do this past week?
The first exam was on Thursday, so I spent what time I had this week studying for it. I really enjoyed the format--multiple choice on Canvas, coding questions on HackerRank. It was just a matter of guessing the UML questions I had forgotten (I missed them) and solving some fairly straightforward Python problems. I also had another exam this week that took up a lot of my time.

## What's in your way?
This week, it looks like my OS project will line up with the SWE project. It's not the end of the world, but it will be busy.

## What will you do next week?
1. Really start working on the next part of the SWE project
2. Do OS project
3. Set aside more time for staying healthy

## What's my experience of the class?
I learned a lot about argument passing in Python this week. In particular, we looked at the `*` and `**` operators which, interestingly enough, do not seem to have names. The `*` operator unpacks lists to positional arguments or packs a variable number of positional arguments into a tuple. The `**` operator unpacks dictionaries into keyword arguments or packs extra keyword arguments into a dictionary. In JavaScript, there is the "spread operator" `...` which functions almost identically to the `*` operator in Python. Unfortunately, JavaScript does not support keyword arguments as does Python, but they can be emulated using object unpacking like this:

```python
# In Python:
def func(a, b, c="default"):
	pass

func(a=1, b=2, c="hello")
```

```javascript
// In JavaScript:
function func({a, b, c="default"}) {
}

func({a: 1, b: 2, c: "hello"});
```

I think this is a bit strange and that Python definitely wins this one.

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I still use Windows on some of my machines and the [Linux Subsystem for Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) is an invaluable tool. Though a relatively new feature in Windows 10, it surprises me that some people are still unaware of this. Essentially, it allows you to run Ubuntu natively on top of Windows, and gives you access to a bash shell which you can use to install and run Linux binaries. If you run an X server in your Windows environment, you can even run graphical applications in Linux:
